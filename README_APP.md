## Team_Profile_Generator
This application takes in info about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The Team Profile Generator is initialized when the user types "node index.js" in the terminal. The terminal then asks the user a series of questions based off of the following topics:
• Employee Name
• Employee ID
• Employee Email Address
• Employee's Office Number (If role is Manager)
• Employee's GitHub Username (If role is Engineer)
• Employee's School (If role is Intern)

Once that has been completed and the user elects to not add any more team members, a html file named "team-profile.html" is created. You can then generate the webpage once you click on the html file and open the browser.
